# Professional Summary

Quantitative methodologist and research scientist with 12+ years translating complex statistical problems into practical guidance for multidisciplinary teams. I combine deep technical expertise with substantive research experience in developmental science, education, and learning—and I build the tools, workflows, and capacity that help teams do rigorous work independently.

# Why This Role: Fit Summary

\fancybulletsstart

- Deep expertise in causal inference, Bayesian methods, longitudinal analysis, measurement theory, and study design—the quantitative methods central to rigorous education research and impact evaluation

- Proven mentoring and capacity building: 12+ years building quantitative skills within multidisciplinary teams through workshops, one-on-one consultation, and reusable tools and templates; demonstrated ability to teach rigorous methods to collaborators across varying statistical backgrounds

- Youth-centered research background: Extensive experience designing and conducting research with adolescents, including vulnerable populations (foster-care-involved youth) requiring enhanced ethical protections; deep knowledge of measurement validity and implementation considerations specific to youth

- Direct education and learning research: Designed and evaluated pedagogical interventions at a learning technology company—testing whether framing assessment as learning improved engagement, and whether communities of practice supported persistence

- Substantive breadth rooted in cognitive and developmental science: Core expertise in cognition, development, and psychometrics extends naturally into mental health, education technology, and learning research—enabling methodological support across foundry10's diverse labs and interest areas

- Committed advocate and practitioner of open science: Published on improving scientific practices in developmental research; proponent of multiverse analysis, pre-registration, and transparent reporting; build and share reusable research tools (R packages, Docker environments, survey scoring pipelines) and apply test-driven development to analytic workflows
