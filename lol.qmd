  - There wasn't a collection that targeted maps (and nothing else, excluding images of, e.g., people holding maps). I use the term "map" a little bit broadly to also include renderings of topographic data and e.g., needlepoint of middle-earth.

  - Thanks to [Finn Brunton](https://sts.ucdavis.edu/people/finn-brunton) for my first introduction, in one of his undergraduate essays, to the delight of footnotes.
- [The website of Gene Keyes, author of the Cahill-Keyes map](https://www.genekeyes.com/index.html)
  - This is a paragon exemplar of early internet website design, and hosts a wealth of thinking on map making, such as [this scathing review of the Fuller Dymaxion map](https://genekeyes.com/FULLER/BF-1-intro.html)
- More coming soon!
