 Statistician / Quantitative Methodologist
Description


foundry10 is an education research organization with a philanthropic focus on expanding ideas about learning and creating direct value for youth. In collaboration with a wide range of partners, we surface, evaluate, and share opportunities to better support youth learning both inside and outside the classroom. Building on more than a decade of impactful work, our unique approach blends applied and basic research, philanthropy, and education programs rooted in evidence-based best practices.


Summary of Role 


We are seeking a highly skilled Statistician/Quantitative Methodologist to serve as a central methodological resource for our research team while also contributing meaningfully to research conducted across the organization. The individual in this role will consult and collaborate with fellow researchers on a diverse array of projects related to education. In addition to providing expert guidance on research design, quantitative analysis, and statistical modeling, this role involves participating as a researcher in a multidisciplinary environment, contributing to organizational learning, leading and contributing to reports, manuscripts, and presentations, and advancing the rigor and quality of our scientific work.


The ideal candidate is both a technical expert and an effective communicator—able to translate complex statistical concepts into practical guidance for collaborators with diverse methodological backgrounds. This position enhances analytic quality, supports innovation in research methods, strengthens open science practices, and contributes to the development and dissemination of rigorous education research. 


This is a full-time, exempt position with an annual salary range of $160,800 to $268,000 and reports to the Senior Research Manager. We are not able to sponsor visa applications, and to be considered for this position, you must be eligible to work in the United States. 


Responsibilities

    Methodological Consultation & Collaboration
        Provide expert guidance on study design, sampling strategies, measurement, and analysis planning across a portfolio of research projects.
        Support fellow researchers in defining research questions, identifying appropriate analytic methods, and determining suitable data sources and study designs.
        Develop, review, and refine statistical analysis plans, including data processing pipelines, modeling approaches, confirmatory hypothesis testing, and exploratory analysis techniques.
        Serve as a thought partner to our research labs and interest areas, offering methodological expertise that enhances project conceptualization, feasibility, and validity.
    Research Design, Quality Assurance, & Ethical Practice
        Support the design of rigorous experiments, observational studies, surveys, and program evaluations.
        Review and provide methodological feedback on research proposals, protocols, analyses, and manuscripts to ensure statistical accuracy and conceptual coherence.
        Provide analytic quality assurance and verification of colleagues’ analyses (e.g., through “auditing” or other open science practices).
        Contribute to developing internal methodological standards, guidelines, templates, and best practices.
        Uphold and promote strong research ethics, including deep familiarity with working with human subjects (and particularly children and adolescents) and the associated methodological considerations.
    Research Participation, Writing, & Dissemination
        Contribute as a researcher to projects aligned with organizational goals, participating in independent and collaborative research efforts.
        Lead or co-author peer-reviewed publications, technical reports, and research briefs.
        Represent the organization at conferences, workshops, and meetings with external partners.
        Support connections with internal program teams, external researchers, and community partners to disseminate findings in accessible formats for technical and non-technical audiences.
    Data Analysis & Advanced Modeling
        Analyze administrative datasets, large-scale survey data, and observational or experimental data emerging from ongoing and future research projects led by fellow researchers in the organization.
        Conduct (either independently or collaboratively with fellow foundry10 researchers) advanced statistical analyses, such as multivariate models, longitudinal analyses, causal inference techniques, Bayesian methods, structural equation modeling, multilevel/hierarchical models, weighted analyses, and network modeling.
        Develop, validate, and document quantitative models and analytic workflows; ensure reproducibility, transparency, and alignment with open science practices.
    Training, Capacity Building, & Team Development
        Provide workshops, trainings, and one-on-one consultation to build quantitative capacity across the research team.
        Contribute to the development and collection of templates and documentation (e.g., R syntax files) to support high-quality analytic work.
        Mentor researchers, supporting colleagues in assessing methodological tradeoffs, identifying impactful research questions, and improving analytic judgment.
        Engage actively with current literature and methodological developments; bring new knowledge into internal discussions and across team projects.
    Operations & Partnership Support
        Contribute to operational or partnership tasks as needed (e.g., coordinating external data collection services, liaising with partner organizations).
        Collaborate across subject areas and quickly gain fluency in new content domains relevant to ongoing and future research projects in education and child development.
