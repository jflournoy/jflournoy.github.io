I am a research scientist with a focus on statistical methodology, psychometrics, and research computing infrastructure. I have published on adolescent health and development, and more recently driven business strategy with insights about software developers and other technologists. My unique perspective and skillset comes from:

- Deep methodological and empirical rigor (which has primarily meant statistical rigor to me), with particular strength in Bayesian modeling using Stan and <code class='bg-light'>brms</code> in R
- A PhD in psychology and background as a (reformed fMRI) neuroscientist, specializing in adolescent development, stress, and well-being
- A strong focus on both empirical and conceptual rigor, integrating quantitative methods with philosophical frameworks and qualitative discovery

My research approach stands out through:

- Advanced statistical modeling and uncertainty quantification across diverse data sources - from traditional surveys and experiments to incidental observational data like Jira tickets (in forthcoming work)
- Extensive experience with longitudinal data at various cadences
- Deep commitment to construct validity and philosophical foundations, shaped profoundly by works like Alexandrova's "A Philosophy for the Science of Well-Being"[Alexandrova, A. (2017). _A philosophy for the science of well-being_. Oxford university press.]{.aside}.

I strive to be effective through this intimate dialogue between our numeric approach, our theory, and our philosophy of the phenomena of interest
