I partner with teams to design and execute rigorous, reproducible researchâ€”combining advanced statistical methods with robust study design to inform decision-making. After earning a PhD in Psychology completing post-doctoral work at Harvard, and most recently leading technologist-focused science as Principal Research Scientist at the Developer Success Lab. I'm available to bring that same rigor directly to your projects. <span class=badge-vapor>ðŸ“¬ [Contact me](mailto:consulting@johnflournoy.science)</span>

## Engagement Model

All work is package-basedâ€”we collaborate on a plan that includes a block of hours each month for live collaboration (video calls, async chat) and all deliverables (analysis scripts, study plans, slide decks). Packages scale from a quick sanity check to an accelerated, end-to-end research sprint.

## What I bring to your team

- *Broad research experience:* 15+ years across multiple methods and domains of inquiry
- *Transparent workflows:* Code and analyses shared via version control with clear documentation and we work together to make sure everything is reproducible.
- *Crafted for your audience:* Reports, slide decks, and visuals are created to be understood by stakeholders with a variety of expertise.
- *Collaborative, communicative:* Regular check-ins and draft reviews keep us aligned.
