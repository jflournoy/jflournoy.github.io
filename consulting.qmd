# You have data. Let's find answers to drive outcomes.

And if you don't have the data _yet_, I'll help you gather it. Whether you're navigating uncertainty, testing a new direction, or refining what already works, I help turn raw data into strategic advantage. My work establishes insights that enables progress you can measure.

## Strategic Research, Scalable Data Science, Trustworthy Results

:::{.lead}

I partner with teams to design and execute rigorous, reproducible research---combining *advanced statistical methods*, *applied data science*, and *robust study design* to inform decision-making.

### Not sure where to start? Figuring that out is part of what I do.


***Can you help us decide what questions are worth answering?***

Yes. I’ll work with you to clarify your goals and refine your questions—so we focus on what matters and design the right strategy to answer it.

***We don’t have clean data—can you still help us?***

Absolutely. Data cleaning is half the work, and I consider it a core competency. I can work with messy, incomplete, or scattered data and help you turn it into something useful.

***Will this work lead to tangible improvements we can present to leadership?***

That’s the goal. From the start, we’ll align on questions that map directly to decisions, priorities, and key indicators. What goes into the slide deck will also move things forward.

***Just need a plan or a second set of eyes?*** 

Packages start at **$500** for things like **analysis** or **research design review**, or **broad research planning advice**. If you need something more involved, we can scope that together.


## Core expertise

I earned my PhD in Psychology at the University of Oregon, completed post-doctoral work at Harvard where I was hired on as a Research Associate, and most recently led technologist-focused science as Principal Research Scientist at the Developer Success Lab. I'm available to bring that same rigor directly to your projects. 


- **Statistical Methods & Modeling**
  - Hierarchical Bayesian models, multilevel & SEM frameworks
  - Simulation studies, causal inference, power analyses
  - Reproducible pipelines in R, Stan, Python, SQL

- **Research & Study Design**
  - Experimental, observational, quasi-experimental, and mixed-methods approaches
  - Pre-registration, sampling frameworks, measurement validation
  - Integrated qualitative insights
  - Survey-embedded experiments

- **Surveys & Instrument Development**
  - Question wording, scale construction, psychometric evaluation
  - Sampling strategies and weighting for representativeness
  - Missing-data handling, data cleaning

- **Applied Qualitative Integration**
  - Qualitative interviewing
  - Thematic transcript coding
  - Quantitative natural language processing

## Engagement Model

All work is package-based—we collaborate on a plan that includes a block of hours each month for live collaboration (video calls, async chat) and all deliverables (analysis scripts, study plans, slide decks). Packages scale from a quick sanity check to an accelerated, end-to-end research sprint.

## What I bring to your team

- *Broad research experience:* 15+ years across multiple methods and domains of inquiry
- *Transparent workflows:* Code and analyses shared via version control with clear documentation and we work together to make sure everything is reproducible.
- *Crafted for your audience:* Reports, slide decks, and visuals are created to be understood by stakeholders with a variety of expertise.
- *Collaborative, communicative:* Regular check-ins and draft reviews keep us aligned.
